# The Game of Assessment
Assessment projects intended to give a strong metric of how experienced a developer is.

#"What is this?"

The Game of Assessment is an open collection of programming projects, written with the goal of being an excellent gauge of the strengths and weaknesses of a novice to intermediate software developer. The projects are written to be easy to understand, and to cover a wide breadth of topics in order to work as a strong assessment.

#Motivation

Ever since [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2013/11/10/meet-a-young-redditor-who-could-teach-some-teachers-a-lesson/) happened, I've had a lot of people ask me to mentor them and guide them along their journey of becoming a software developer.

The first question I always ask them is, "what do you already know?" 

Of course, that's a hard question to answer. Naturally, the best way to find the answer to that question is to look at code they've written. Even better, give them a task to do and watch their process - then becomes immediately obvious what they're strong at, and what needs work.

I'm always wondering what the best task to give is. Ideally, it's a large enough task that it ends up being more than a couple of lines to solve. Also, it should be relatively open ended so that there's interesting design choices to be made, so that I can see how they handle assumptions and evaluate their choices.

From that, the Game of Assessment was born.

#Usage

In the Projects folder, you'll find markdown documents, each with a project described. The projects are self contained and can be attempted in any order.

To start an attempt, fork this repository and regularly commit your work. I'm always interested in seeing progress! Exemplary solutions to problems will be given the recognition it deserves in the project document.

If you would like people to give feedback on your solution, put a line saying something along the lines of "I am looking for feedback on my solution" in the README of your fork.

#Contributing

I wholeheartedly welcome contributions to this repository. Please feel free to submit pull requests for grammar and formatting changes. If you'd like to write a new project, that's even better! Check the [Guidelines](Guidelines.md) for what a project should strive to be.

I will review submitted projects and communicate feedback, and eventually merge them into the repository. You will be given full credit for any projects that you submit.

Additionally, check the forks of the repository for solution attempts made by other people. If they have explicitly asked for feedback on their solution, please feel free to help them out! **Avoid giving feedback to people who have not asked for it, as some people may find criticism to be discouraging.** You can read the [Feedback section in the Guidelines](Guidelines.md#feedback) for tips on how to give good constructive advice.
